## ‚ùá Introduction
People on long-term treatment suffer from two problems: following the treatment correctly and staying engaged during it. The main cause of this problem is that each person has a specific engagement along with a lack of clarity in visualizing the progress of the treatment. In order to deal with this problem, mHealth applications have been developed. Although mHealth improves patient engagement, the unavailability of developers to develop these applications according to the treatment of each patient reduces its reachability. This work proposes a no-code platform that allows healthcare professionals to create mHealth applications for their patients according to their care plan. Our goal is to allow healthcare professionals to create mobile applications that show treatment progress and use elements that engage their patients. With this, we hope to contribute so that patients on long-term treatment do not abandon it over time and follow it correctly.
